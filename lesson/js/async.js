/**
 * This JavaScript code snippet demonstrates the use of the Fetch API for making HTTP requests
 * and handling asynchronous operations.
 *
 * The first part of the code makes a single fetch request and demonstrates how to handle
 * the response and possible errors using Promise chaining.
 *
 * The second part consists of two async functions: `asyncBadImplemented` and `asyncGoodImplemented`.
 * Both functions perform the same task - making multiple fetch requests to the same URL and
 * parsing the responses as JSON - but they use different approaches.
 *
 * `asyncBadImplemented` waits for each fetch request to complete before starting the next one,
 * resulting in inefficient use of time when dealing with multiple independent async operations.
 *
 * `asyncGoodImplemented`, on the other hand, uses Promise.all to perform all fetch requests in parallel,
 * leading to more efficient execution.
 *
 * The code demonstrates the importance of properly handling async operations in JavaScript and
 * shows the potential performance improvements that can be achieved by running independent async
 * operations in parallel instead of sequentially.
